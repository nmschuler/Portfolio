ASSIGNMENTS
====================
The assignments were all together to make one larger project for the semester. Each assignment is considered an iteration. The beginning of each assignment, the professor gave us all code, so the entire class starts off at the same spot.



EXAMS
====================
The exams were given in three parts: multiple choice, essay, and practical. The attached code for the exams contains the practical portion.
